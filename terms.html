            <h4>Marketing Services and Beverages Purchases</h4>
            <p>201 Ventures LLC provides a marketing service, and a marketing service only, to our partner venues (“Venues” or a “Venue”), by referring qualified Drop In users to visit and pay for products and services at these Venues. Your registration with Drop In is simply for the acknowledgement to be a Drop In user and provide access to use our Site and App. At no time are you buying any alcoholic beverage from 201 Ventures LLC. 201 Ventures LLC may pay Venues for a limited amount of drinks provided to qualified Drop In users. In some states, such as New York, where State Alcoholic Beverage Control (“ABC”) laws and regulations prohibit a Venue from providing a free drink to a customer without the purchase of another drink, users are required to purchase at least one additional drink at no less than the same regular retail price of the complimentary drink. Failure to abide by applicable ABC laws and regulations are grounds for immediate termination of your account with no further obligations for 201 Ventures.</p>
            <p>Having access to Drop In does not guarantee you entry or service at Venues at all times. Venues may refuse entrance or service if they determine at their sole discretion that you violate their code of conduct or display unacceptable behavior in any way. In States where alcohol control laws and regulations require a purchase of an additional drink, Venues may enforce such purchase if you do not voluntarily make such purchase.</p>
